# Social Care - A reliable hospital booking service
### FOSS2020HACK

**Are you tired of waiting in a long queue to consult a doctor?**

**Now outpatient appointment booking has become online and easy.**

Our project aims to develop an effective outpatient appointment scheduling system.

The objective of these appointment systems is to minimize the difficulties incurred by patients waiting.

Emerging pandemics show that humans are not infallible and communities need to be prepared. Recently Coronavirus outbreak pulled us to follow restrictive measures like social distancing, disinfecting hospitals, contact tracing, etc.  But the long waiting queue on the doctor&#39;s doorstep makes us fail such prevention methods.
